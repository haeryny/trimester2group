We are going to take notes on the videos for 3.3 and 3.4 and begin to create a place where it sums up all the notes into one source. 

Then we are going to create examples of the things we learned from the videos, such as showing an algorithm and labeling the different parts while the people run it. 

Our hacks/homework assignment will be practice problems from the notes.
