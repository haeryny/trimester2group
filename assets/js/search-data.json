Algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways and can be executed by programs which are implemented using programming languages. | Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration | . An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. . Sequencing is doing steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. . Selection is when the programmer decides between two different outcomes. . Iteration is when you have to repeat a step until that condition is fulfilled. . Examples . Most algorithms use a flow chart to demonstrate how the algorithm proceeds. . Set largestNumber to 0 | Get next number in list | If number is larger than largestNumber then set largestNumber to number | If there are more numbers in list, go back to Step 2 | Display largestNumber | Sequencing: Steps 1-5 in order . Selection: Step 3 . Iteration: Step 4 . ## These are all the steps that the computer goes through so this is sequencing numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] evens = [] ## This is selection where they go through the numbers and decide whether if it is even or not. for i in numbers: ## This is iteration because they repeat the steps until they go through all the numbers in the list. if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0): evens.append(numbers[i]) print(evens) .

Then we are going to create examples of the things we learned from the videos, such as showing an algorithm and labeling the different parts while the people run it. . Our hacks/homework assignment will be practice problems from the notes. .",
