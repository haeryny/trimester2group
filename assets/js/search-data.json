            "content": "3.3 Video 1 . Learning Objective . Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using a programming language . Essential Knowledge . Algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways and can be executed by programs which are implemented using programming languages. | Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration | . An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. . Sequencing is doing steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. . Selection is when the programmer decides between two different outcomes. . Iteration is when you have to repeat a step until that condition is fulfilled. . Examples . Most algorithms use a flow chart to demonstrate how the algorithm proceeds. . Set largestNumber to 0 | Get next number in list | If number is larger than largestNumber then set largestNumber to number | If there are more numbers in list, go back to Step 2 | Display largestNumber | Sequencing: Steps 1-5 in order . Selection: Step 3 . Iteration: Step 4 . 3.3 Video 2 . algorithm- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. | sequencing- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given | variable- you can store an actual value, the value of a variable in another variable, the result of an operation, or result of a procedural call | . Practice: calculate and display average of 25, 43, and 18 . num 1 &lt;– 25 | num 2 &lt;– 43 | num 3 &lt;– 18 | average &lt;– (num 1 + num 2 + num 3)/3 | display average = 28.667 3.3 Video 3 . | . 3.4 Video 1 .",
