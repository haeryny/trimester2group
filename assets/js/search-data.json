            "content": "3.3 Video 1 . Learning Objective . Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using a programming language . Essential Knowledge . Algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways and can be executed by programs which are implemented using programming languages. | Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration | . An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. . Sequencing is doing steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. . Selection is when the programmer decides between two different outcomes. . Iteration is when you have to repeat a step until that condition is fulfilled. . Examples . Most algorithms use a flow chart to demonstrate how the algorithm proceeds. . Set largestNumber to 0 | Get next number in list | If number is larger than largestNumber then set largestNumber to number | If there are more numbers in list, go back to Step 2 | Display largestNumber | Sequencing: Steps 1-5 in order . Selection: Step 3 . Iteration: Step 4 . 3.3 Video 2 . Vocabulary . algorithm- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. | selection- a section of code is run only if a condition is met. | iteration- repeating steps or instructions over and over again | sequencing- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given | variable- you can store an actual value, the value of a variable in another variable, the result of an operation, or result of a procedural call | . Practice: calculate and display average of 25, 43, and 18 . num 1 ⟵ 25 . num 2 ⟵ 43 . num 3 ⟵ 18 . average ⟵ (num 1 + num 2 + num 3)/3 . display average . Click for the answer! 28.667 Practice: consider the following code segment, which uses the variables a, b, c: . a ⟵ 1 . b ⟵ 2 . c ⟵ 3 . a ⟵ b . b ⟵ c . display(a) . display(c) . which is displayed as a result of running the code segment 1 1 | 1 2 | 2 3 | 3 2 | | . Click for the answer! 3. 2 3 Practice: consider the following code segment . s ⟵ 10 . l ⟵ 20 . a ⟵ 30 . y ⟵ 40 . s ⟵ l . l ⟵ a . y ⟵ l . a ⟵ s . what is the value of a as a result of executing the code segment? . 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | Click for the answer! 2. 20 3.3 Video 3 . Mathematical Expressions . Arithmetic Operators . A plus sign indicates addition: a + b . A subtraction sign indicates subtraction: a - b . An asterisk/star indicates multiplication: a * b . A slash indicates division: a / b . MOD represent the Modulus operator. Returns the value after division: a MOD b . ex: 9 MOD 2 = 1 . Practice Problem . . answer: 29 . 3.4 Video 1 . Big Idea: Strings . Goal: To evaluate expressions that manipulate strings . Vocab and Examples: . String: a sequence of characters . Len: finds the number of characters in a string . len(“school”) . Result: “5” ———————————————————— . | String concatenation: combines two or more strings into one . concat(“computers”, “arecool” ) . Result: “computersarecool” ———————————————————— . | Substring: a part of a existing string . substring(“APCSPrinciples”, 3, 6) . Result: “CSPrin” . Starts at the 3rd character (“C”) and takes 6 characters after that (“SPrin), then in all (“CSPrin”) . |",
